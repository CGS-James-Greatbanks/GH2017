# Distance

#### by Heckermen

---

### Concept:

Using A-Frame, jQuery, homebrew Blender assets, we have created a web application to "physically" represent data in a more comprehensible and visual form.

For example, when demonstrating how much oil a person consumes in a given timeframe, Distance uses assets rendered in Blender (for instance, a barrel of oil) to visually display data from otherwise incomprehensibly large datasets and making them much more  visually intuitive, representative and tangible.
